# Monet Painting Style GAN Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images in the style of Claude Monet paintings. The work is part of a Kaggle "Getting Started" competition: [GANs - Getting Started](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started).

GANs consist of two neural networks — a generator and a discriminator — that compete with each other to create increasingly realistic images. The goal is to generate Monet-style images that can fool the discriminator, producing visually appealing artwork in Monet's style.

## Problem Description

The challenge is to generate **7,000 to 10,000** high-quality Monet-style images (64x64 RGB PNG images). The generated images are evaluated using the Memorization-informed Fréchet Inception Distance (MiFID) metric, which measures similarity to real Monet paintings while penalizing memorization of training samples.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of Monet paintings provided by Kaggle in TFRecord format. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started/data).
